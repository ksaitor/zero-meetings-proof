# Zero Meetings Proof
> A new Blockchain Scalability Solution

## Abstract
**Zero Meetings Proof** or **ZMP** is a revolutionary off-chain scaling mechanism that lets core blockchain developers focus on shipping code instead of going into f*cking one-on-one coffee meetings every day. Period.

## 1. Mechanism
ZMP technology is *compatible* with all existing and non-yet-existing blockchains and can be easily integrated (your mileage may vary).
In order to successfully integrate ZMP in your project, you will require
1. a project that is gaining enough traction for people to be willing to invite you or your engineers to "grab a coffee and chat"
1. a few competent engineers, that are already working on scalability problems
1. willpower to say "NO": learn to disagree and say __NO__ to bullshit, you are here to build the future, not make babies. As    Pieter levels [says](https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/935452839924572161), by avoiding meetings you and your engineers      will be able to actually get stuff done and scale your system 100x. You will almost always have larger 
   impact gulping beer, listening to EDM and crunching code than speaking at a meetup filled with people asking questions        that can easily be googled. [NO SHIT](http://bfy.tw/H7xq) 

## 2. Benefits

1. *Most* of the meetups are dumb. They don't add any real value to your life, rather, they create this fictional bubble in your head that makes you believe you are important and being productive. **STOP** Right there. It's a trap. 
 
2. Zero meetups = More time = Balanced work life = More Sleep = Health = Increased productivity. [QUICK MATHS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X09oxyIeGuY) :beer:

3. Save dumb travel expenses. Buy :beer: instead.
